    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a software developer with experience and expertise on mobile
      platforms, particularly Android. Over the past 13 years, I have
      contributed to four large, globally successful apps (including building
      one from scratch), helped launch several pieces of consumer electronics,
      and led a small team of Android developers.

    <p>
      Having done mobile development for 13 years, I am ready to move on to a
      new challenge: web development. I am working through The Complete 2023 Web
      Development Bootcamp on Udemy.
